	/* 

    Abstraction is a process of hiding implementation details and showing
    only functionality to the user E.g when you type and send a message, you don't
    know about the internal processing about the message delivery
    
    There are 2 ways to achieve abstraction in java 
    1. Abstract class
    2. Interface
    
    Points to remember
    1. Abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword
    2. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods
    3. It cannot be instantiated
    it can have constructors and static methods too
    it can have final methods which force a subclass not to change the body of the method
    
    Rule: if there is an abstract method in a class, that class must be abstract
    
    
    Guidance on examples
    1. Abstract class: Bank, BankA, BankB and TestBank java files
    2. Interface: SalaryManager(interface) and then Doctor and Nurse are classes that implement SalaryManager interface
       plus SalaryCalculator that demonstrates functionality
