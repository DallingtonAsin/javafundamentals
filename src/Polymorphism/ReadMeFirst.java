	Polymorphism: ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form
	E.g in real life, a man can be a husband, father, employee

	In java, there are 2 types of polymorphism ie. compile-time/ static polymorphism and runtime/dynamic dispatch polymorphis

	Compile time polymorphism is achieved through method overloading(When there are multiple functions
	with the same name but different parameters(method signature is different) then these functions are said to be overloaded)

	Runtime polymorphism is achieved through method overriding(occurs when a derived class has a definition
	for one of the member functions of the base class )
	
	Since you have this knowledge, then lets go ahead and see examples
	1. Method Overloading: MethodOverloading and TestMethodOverloading java files
	2. Method Overriding: Animal, Cow, Dog and TestMethodOverriding java files
